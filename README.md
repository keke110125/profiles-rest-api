# Profiles REST API

Profiles REST API course code.

Profiles API design:
1. Create new profile
2. List existing profiles
3. View specific profiles
4. Update profile of logged in user

API URLs:
1. /api/profile/ List all profiles when HTTP GET method is called; Create new profile when HTTP POST method is called
2. /api/profile/<profile_id>/ View specific profile details by using HTTP GET; Update object using HTTP PUT/PATCH; Remove it completely using HTTP DELETE
